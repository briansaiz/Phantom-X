## Cinematic analysis of the robot
The first step was take the measurements of the Phantom in the laboratory, obtaining the following results:
 - L1 = 145 [mm]
 - L2 = 107 [mm]
 - L3 = 107 [mm]
 - L4 = 80 [mm]

The first one, reference systems are assigned according to the DHstd convention. In this case, you can si the Root Phantom that is plotted with the tool in Matlab.
The goal of this lab ismanipulate the Phantom X robot using the laptop keyboard and ROS.
